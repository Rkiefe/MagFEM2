# MagFEM2
This is a simple and efficient implementation of the finite element method in 2D for magnetostatics. I decided to create this for anyone who looks at FEMCE and wants to make somthing similar. This code uses a different approach and is only for 2D and for the linear case. Can't give all my secrets away.

#-\nabla \cdot \vec{H} = \nabla \vec{M}#
